**Instructions on how to run programs:**
1) Install Java JDK if it has not already been installed
2) Verify successful installation by typing `java -version` in the terminal.
3) In the terminal, navigate to the src folder of the selected project and build the project with the command `javac Main.java`. 
4) To find the solution for an input file, type `java Main.java [filename]`, e.g. `java Main.java Input1.txt`. 
An output.txt will be created at the same location as the input file.
